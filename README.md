# Explanation Of The Project

This project demonstrates how to use Python's Turtle graphics library to draw a grid of dots with colors extracted from the "image.jpg" file. 
The script extracts the colors in RGB format using python's colorgram library, and uses those colors to draw dots on a Turtle graphics window. 
This project shows how to extract a list of colors from a jpg file, convert it into RGB form and use it in your own GUI.
